# BIOS for Cerberus computers

## Cerberus 2100

Best way use BIOS for Cerberus 2100 from [official computer's repository](https://github.com/TheByteAttic/CERBERUS2100).

Here it will be for reference or current development versions.

## Cerberus 2080

Please use my version of BIOS - it's fully compatible with original BBC Basic's BIOS but extended for support W65C02S basic.
